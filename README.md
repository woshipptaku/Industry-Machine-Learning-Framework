# Industry-Machine-Learning-Framework
A general and integrated CAE &amp; machine learning framework that accelerates the implementation of smart industry
This a 26-month project motivated by the impressive experience in semi-working in renewable energy industry and WWT industry. 
I was deeply felt that integration of CAE simulation (physical pde model) and machine learning (heuristical & data-driven model) is around the corner, fueling up the world in the next 10 years. Therefore, a general-use framework is essential.
